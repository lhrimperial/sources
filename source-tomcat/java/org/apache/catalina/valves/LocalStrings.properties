# All status codes registered with IANA can be found at
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xml
http.400.reason=Bad Request
http.400.desc=The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
http.401.reason=Unauthorized
http.401.desc=The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
http.402.reason=Payment Required
http.402.desc=This status code is reserved for future use.
http.403.reason=Forbidden
http.403.desc=The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
http.404.reason=Not Found
http.404.desc=The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.
http.405.reason=Method Not Allowed
http.405.desc=The method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource.
http.406.reason=Not Acceptable
http.406.desc= The target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request, and the server is unwilling to supply a default representation.
http.407.reason=Proxy Authentication Required
http.407.desc=This status code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.
http.408.reason=Request Timeout
http.408.desc= The server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.
http.409.reason=Conflict
http.409.desc=The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.
http.410.reason=Gone
http.410.desc= Access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent.
http.411.reason=Length Required
http.411.desc=The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length.
http.412.reason=Precondition Failed
http.412.desc=One or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.
http.413.reason=Payload Too Large
http.413.desc=The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
http.414.reason=URI Too Long
http.414.desc=The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
http.415.reason=Unsupported Media Type
http.415.desc=The origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.
http.416.reason=Range Not Satisfiable
http.416.desc=None of the ranges in the request's Range header field overlap the current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.
http.417.reason=Expectation Failed
http.417.desc=The expectation given in the request's Expect header field could not be met by at least one of the inbound servers.
http.421.reason=Misdirected Request
http.421.desc=The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.
http.422.reason=Unprocessable Entity
http.422.desc=The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct but was unable to process the contained instructions.
http.423.reason=Locked
http.423.desc=The source or destination resource of a method is locked.
http.424.reason=Failed Dependency
http.424.desc=The method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed.
http.426.reason=Upgrade Required
http.426.desc=the server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.
http.428.reason=Precondition Required
http.428.desc=The origin server requires the request to be conditional.
http.429.reason=Too Many Requests
http.429.desc=The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
http.431.reason=Request Header Fields Too Large

http.451.reason=Unavailable For Legal Reasons
http.451.desc=The server refused this request for legal reasons.
http.500.reason=Internal Server Error
http.500.desc=The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
http.501.reason=Not Implemented
http.501.desc=The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
http.502.reason=Bad Gateway

http.506.reason=Variant Also Negotiates
http.506.desc=The server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is thereforenot a proper end point in the negotiation process.
http.507.reason=Insufficient Storage
http.507.desc=The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.
http.508.reason=Loop Detected

http.510.reason=Not Extended
