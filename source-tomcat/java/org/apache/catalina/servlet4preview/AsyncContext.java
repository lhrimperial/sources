 * @deprecated This class is not included in Tomcat 9 onwards. Users of this
 *             class should normally upgrade to Tomcat 9 and switch to the
 *             Servlet 4.0 API. If the functionality is required in Tomcat 8.5,
 *             then the Tomcat implementation classes should be used directly.
 *             This class may be removed from Tomcat 8.5.x some time after 30
 *             September 2018.
